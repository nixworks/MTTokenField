##MTTokenField

MTTokenField is a replacement for NSTokenField to allow for better completion handling for stems that do not necessarily occur at the beginning of the completion options.

It was developed to better handle the problem of users employing non alphanumeric symbols or emoji as the leading character.

When I set the NSTokenField delegate to return completions that ignore leading symbols, the selection in the tokenfield behaves in such a way it make it difficult to continue typing for the autocompletion.

MTTokenfield handles this better.


###Caveat

This is still an incomplete implementation.

It doesn't handle drag and drop, copying the token array, rendering of tokens in a selected state etc.
